## Prompt
**Example Prompts by Technique:**

1. **Zero-Shot:**  
*"You are a retail customer support chatbot. Provide a concise answer to a customer asking about the status of their order."*

2. **Role-Playing:**  
*"Act as a friendly sales assistant in an electronics store. Guide the customer through selecting a laptop based on their needs."*

3. **Few-Shot:**  
*"Customer: I want to return my product.  
Chatbot: Sure! Please provide your order ID.  
Customer: 12345  
Chatbot: Thank you. Your return request is processed.  
Now respond to a new customer asking about shipping delays."*

4. **Chain-of-Thought:**  
*"Explain step-by-step how to check order status and what options the customer has if delivery is delayed."*

5. **Refinement:**  
*"Rewrite the previous chatbot response to be more concise, polite, and professional while maintaining all essential information."*
